# Print-Wiki
Bash script for archiving an entire wiki's worth of HTML pages

This script was developed/tested using an older version of mediawiki, and for a specific use case.

The API has changed slightly and won't work without modification for something like wikipedia, nor should it be tried.  Some wiki pages have specific requirements regulating how many requests can occur in a specific timeframe.  This script has the ability to eat up a lot of storage space, and a lot of bandwidth.
